# CS330
OpenGL

This repository is for my code used with learning OpenGL.
The primary file is the final project for CS330 which was to create a static 3d scene using OpenGL.

How do I approach designing software?
  What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  What design process did you follow for your project work?
  How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

  For this project, I first took a few picture of what I was going to be designing.  I went through and made choices about what to add into the scene and what to leave out.
  I didn't want to code anything excessively detailed, but I also didn't want the scene to be overly basic.  I had to choose a balance between complexity and simplicity when
  choosing how to create each object from the basic meshes.  One of the skills that I developed was being able to go back and troubleshoot code that was given to me.  There
  were 2 or 3 times where something didn't work as expected and I had to dive through the errors and code to see why. 

How do I approach developing programs?
  What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
  How did iteration factor into your development?
  How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

  One of my strategies for developing the code was to get one thing working at a time.  I made sure that whatever object I was working on was just how I wanted it.  At the start
  I could focus on just building and scalling objects.  Add a cylinder, scale it, rotate it, and then place it in the scene.  Later, this translated to getting one texture working
  at a time.  Add a texture, make sure it could load, and that it applied to the object, and then playing with things like UV scaling.  Same for working with lighting.  I would add
  one light, get it correct, and then disable it while I played with the next light.  Then I would enable both lights to see if it had the look I wanted.  This iterative approach
  helped me to pin down what each variable for each part controlled and made it easier with each new object to know what I wanted to change and how.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
  
  While this course has certainly added to my coding skills, it isn't something that I aspire to use all the time.  I am more interested in working with large scale databases
  and machine learning.  Not that these tpes of graphics aren't useful, but they probably won't have much application in terms of databases or making GUIs for them.
